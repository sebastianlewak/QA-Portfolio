# QA Portfolio

Welcome to my QA Portfolio! Below, you'll find an overview of my work in software testing, including test scenarios, test cases, and bug reports that I created for a specific web application. I've also provided links to the website I tested and additional resources demonstrating my testing methodologies and ongoing learning.

## 📂 Test Artifacts

## 🌐 Tested Application

I tested a web application to ensure its functionality, performance, and security met the required standards. Below is the link to the website:

### 1. Test Scenarios
Test scenarios define the high-level functions or parts of the web application that I have tested. These are designed to ensure all critical aspects of the system have been covered.

### 2. Test Cases
Test cases are detailed steps that describe the actions performed during testing, along with the expected results. Each test case is linked to a specific test scenario.

### 4. Custom Form and SQL Database Testing

As part of my testing work, I developed and tested a custom form built in **React**, integrated with a local **SQL database**. The testing process included:

- **Form Validation**: Ensured that all input fields were properly validated according to the defined requirements.
- **Database Integration**: Tested the connection between the form and the SQL database, focusing on data storage, retrieval, and query accuracy.
- **SQL Queries**: Created and validated SQL queries to ensure data integrity and correct data manipulation within the database.

- **Cypress**

## 📝 Summary

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to perform comprehensive software testing, from planning and writing test cases to identifying and documenting bugs. I am skilled in using industry-standard tools like TestRail and Jira to manage the testing process effectively. Additionally, my experience with SQL and custom forms showcases my capability to handle both frontend and backend testing. My ongoing learning in Selenium and Cypress reflects my commitment to advancing my automation testing skills.
